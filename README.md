# Object Tracking Robot using C++ under ev3dev Env
---
This Lego robotic application uses ev3dev, which is a popular Debian Linux-based operating system that runs on several LEGO MINDSTORMS.
The main aim of this project is to get good exposure on some of the real world applications using the power of linux and traditional programming languages like c or c++

- This Object Tracking Robot uses 
two lego large motors, one medium motor, one ultrasonic sensor, one touch sensor and performs moving action towards a nearest object with in some paricular range and constraints.
